# interactivr
Interactive VR for android smartphones.

The aim of this project is to bring interactivity in VR on non-Daydream-ready Android phones.
The basic idea is that the built-in sensors inside modern android phones can be used to turn the phone into
a VR controller.

The advantages of this would be:
-A separate daydream controller is not required.
-A daydream-ready phone is not required.
