<h3>Interactive VR for android smartphones</h3>

The aim of this project is to bring interactivity in VR on non-Daydream-ready Android phones.
The basic idea is that the built-in sensors inside modern android phones can be used to turn the phone into
a VR controller.

The advantages of this would be: <br>
<ul>
<li>A smartphone can be used instead of a separate daydream controller.
<li>A daydream-ready phone is not required.
</ul>
